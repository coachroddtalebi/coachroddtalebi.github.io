    About a week ago, I sent the following email to the Varsity Women Squad to begin a new conversation on our team culture.
    <br><br>

    <div id="quote"><i>
    As mentioned in my <a id="link" href="https://coachroddtalebi.github.io/blog-1.html">first blog post</a> I think it is important for everyone to reflect on the machinations of how their mind processes and internalizes information...your conceptual framework.
    <br><br>
    As a follow up to that I’m asking all of you to fill out an anonymous survey on how you define certain concepts relevant to the sport of rowing and to the shaping of our team culture. Now here is the important thing to reflect on: your answers should reflect the way YOU define or think about the concepts, not the way SOCIETY or STATUS QUO defines them. For your own growth, try to avoid one-line answers; really deepen on the questions.
    <br><br>
    Hopefully your answers reflect how complex and multi-dimensional these concepts really are, especially in trying to formulate objective statements on them. As always, this is just one piece of a continuous dialogue we will have on these concepts.
    <br><br>

    Today, we had our first meeting as a group together marking the highly anticipated start to the new season. For the first 30 minutes, we continued that conversation…here are the highlights.
    <br><br>
    <center>
    _______________________________________________________________________________________________

    <br><br>
    I hope that, after all the emails and blog posts from this summer, it is evident to all of you how much we are investing in the team’s culture; and from your responses on how most rated the whole team culture as better than that of this squad, there is a recognition from you all on the importance of just that.
    <br><br>
    The first major step to that is in redefining and reevaluating the mindset and attributes that make up the environment in our team: competition, motivation, excellence.
    <br><br>
    <center>
    <img src="images/compass.jpg" alt="Compass";>
    </center>
    <br><br>
    I want to introduce the idea of a compass; say that we all have this compass that guides us on our decision-making. In the name of a single united team, how can we align our compasses?
    <br><br>
    To work together and make decisions that support each other, we must first respect each other, not just those immediate friends on the team. This next season will be extremely difficult and anyone who can work through it along side you deserves your respect. These are your sisters; you don’t have to be best friends with every one, but you will respect and love them. Let your compass and all your decisions be guided off that. Everyone on this team has their own trials and tribulations: family problems, relationship problems, death, depression, anxiety, etc. All of that is on this team; what are you going to do to keep your sisters afloat? What are you going to do to make the team culture a 10/10? How do you define excellence and competition in a way that reflects and supports such an environment?
    <br><br>
    Competition cannot be used as tool for hate but rather let it be an instrument for pursuing excellence. Let excellence be both your individual goal and your hope for your teammates. Let you achieve such a level of competition that in loss you look forward to shaking the hand of the individual who beat you; and in victory, may your opponent show you respect. In loss, let the hate not come across you, rather let your disappointment or anger be reason to inspire you to work harder in achieving excellence.
    <br><br>
    For that reason, I look at the slogans spread on our shirts with some disapproval.
    <br>
    <div id="quote"><b>
    Plan to Win<br>
    Prepare to Win<br>
    Expect to Win</b>
    </div>
    <br>

    This trivializes the whole commitment of an athlete and the level of competition we hope to achieve. Winning isn’t enough; it’s about the journey and the process; it’s about how we win but also how we lose. On this squad, we are modifying that slogan to something that better reflects our more high dimensional understanding of competition and motivation.
    <div id="quote"><b>
    Plan for Excellence<br>
    Prepare for Excellence<br>
    Pursue Excellence</b>
    </div>
    <br>

    In my final thoughts, I challenge you to reintroduce the role of the individual in this conversation. How can we discuss the responsibility of the individual athlete and the effect they have in shaping the team culture and performance without introducing the ego? How do we remove the ego from the individual? How can we redefine the concept of the ego to not only include notions of “I’m better than everyone else” but also notions of “I suck and can’t do this”? How do we remove this preoccupation of the self?
