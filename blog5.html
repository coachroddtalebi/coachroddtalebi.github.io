    Every race is a privilege.
    <br><br>

    Now what does that mean? Take a step back and look at your life from the outside; this is an extremely rare moment where you and group of your peers put in hours of work every day to compete at a high collegiate level across the country. Unless you are lucky enough to continue as a national rower, outside of these 4 years, you will never be able to race like this ever again. You can stick with the sport, buy your own shell, join a master’s program, or become a coach, but you will never ever be able to train and compete on this level. Never again. Every race is a privilege.
    <br><br>

    Sitting at attention at the starting block, think of all those who have worn the same Georgia Tech uniform and have sat in the same seat; think of those who worked decades ago to establish and to keep alive this team; and think of those who will continue the legacy. Think of Georgia Tech and of the national stage you are representing your university at; think of all the people who put in the work for their entire youth-hood to have the chance to represent a prestigious collegiate institution. Think of how, in that moment, you are not just an individual, you are not just a group of nine, you are Georgia Tech Rowing. Every race is a privilege.
    <br><br>

    But not all races are created equal. Each serve a different purpose, but every single one is an opportunity to learn and to improve. Any attempt to simplify the importance of a race, in turn, reduces its value; the two extremes need to be avoided: “every race needs to be treated like the grand finals” or “no race is important unless it’s the championships”. As the coach, it is my goal and responsibility to well communicate the purpose of every practice and of every race so that the entire team shares the same understanding; something I hope to elaborate on continually throughout each season. But for now, we shift our attention to the implications the above statements make to the manner in which we conduct ourselves at a race whether it is a dual or a major regatta.
    <br><br>

    The individual has a responsibility to the team, to contribute into making that day a success. Do your part, but also make sure that everyone is also actively participating. Be an example to the novices and hold your peers to high standard. It’s the little things and the big things: pick up your trash, pick up other’s trash, rig and derig properly, do not make fun of other teams, respect and do not hate your competition.
    <br><br>

    The list goes on but the underlying concept remains the same: it is an honor and a privilege to do what you do; shape your attitude and your actions to reflect that.
    <br><br>

    And finally, the discussion on the responsibility you have to your teammates and to yourself. Historically this team has had a problem prioritizing things on race day and it’s simply embarrassing…
    <br><br>

    A varsity athlete at SIRA walking around in the sun before grand finals, not knowing what to do for food, being forced to stay hydrated and off their feet; how does someone spend all year training only to foolishly go about how they prepare themselves for the last race of the Regional Championships. Big middle finger to their teammates, to the coaches, and to themselves. I hope you never ever have to look back at your collegiate career and have a regret like that; memories are fragile and as you get older, fewer and fewer are retained, but I guarantee to you that letting down your teammates will be something you will carry with you for life. Don’t have me to tell any of you twice to get off your feet, or to stay hydrated, or to stay fueled.
    <br><br>

    We are elevating the expectations in every aspect of how this team operates. Remember and champion that.
