    I came across this article from ESPN recently and I thought it was a good example about how being an athlete is so much more than just the workouts; it's about a lifestyle. <br>
    <a id="espn" href="http://cdn.espn.go.com/blog/pittsburgh-steelers/post/_/id/24375/hydrations-massages-ivs-yoga-what-nfl-players-spend-upwards-of-300000-on-to-stay-young">Read Article Here</a>
    <br><br>
    Now I'm not saying that everyone should go and get acupuncture or throw all their time and money into the sport; all I'm saying is that you have to treat your experience as an athlete as a complex multidimensional process. You don't just go to practice every day and then get medals thrown at you; you have to think about how much sleep you get, what kind of food you are eating, what you are doing to help your body recover and stay efficient, how to reduce stress, what to focus on and what to ignore, how to prioritize, etc. 
    <br><br>
    Of course we haven't even touched the water yet, but it is important to start thinking about what kind of athlete you want to be, so that day 1 all you do is execute.
    <br><br>
    This entire discussion reminded me of an email I sent to the varsity men almost two years ago. I'm going to copy-paste it below with a few minor changes.
    <br><br>
    ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    <br><br>
    Now my main objective of this email was to talk about this idea of being a Student Athlete and how we can further push the envelope in redefining this term to something that isn't dichotomous in nature, but rather a state of mind exhibiting a supportive and reciprocal relationship: how can we be an athlete in our studies and a student in the boat?
    <br><br>
    Sometimes being a student athlete implies that you're just a full time athlete enrolled in a school; that your studies don't matter, but each of you were accepted to this school because of your studies and not for your rowing skills. You are of course here to get a degree to then earn a living. Whether you have realized it or not, this team is the perfect example of how students can commit themselves to excellence in their studies while pushing the limits of mind and body as an athlete in rowing. It is absolutely possible to do both, and even more powerful if you can change your mindset and lifestyle so that each helps the other. You are not a student athlete just in the classroom, or only on the water, you are a student athlete at every moment of your collegiate career and the same discipline you put on the water and the classroom should be reflected in the rest of your daily activities...but let's focus now on that idea of being a student in the boat and an athlete in the classroom.
    <br><br>
    A student on the water is someone who comes to practice knowing what they need to work on as an individual AND as a boat. They set goals for themselves and fight to meet them. They ask questions and are proactive in their learnings. They fight for attention to make sure that they're becoming the best so that their boat becomes the best. They're showing us how not only are they positively affecting the boat by improving themselves, but they are inspiring focus and concentration to their oarsmen around them. They recognize that they can't excel just by being better than those around them, but rather that they can only reach their full potential when the team as whole is reaching it together. The stroke seat of the top boat is only at his best when the coxswain is at his/her best, or when the men behind him are at their best, or when the second or third boats are at their best. They recognize that being a good athlete is being a SMART athlete, so that every decision they make during their day is done with both rowing and school in mind...should I go partying tonight or rest up? should I do that crazy extra workout or should I do some active recover instead? Being smart is using discretion in every aspect, whether its over-training or under-committing. A student will also question the philosophy of the sport: Is this all about raw physicality or is there a sensitive side? And how does that change the mindset I would have when I row?
    <br><br>
    On the other side of the relationship, you have to be an athlete in school by bringing the determination and focus of practice to how you study. Your strategy in knowing how to do well in school is huge! Obviously if you do well on homework and tests, you will do well in class, but having a strategy, schedule, and standards to how to do that is what distinguishes people in school and, more importantly and notably, in a career.
    <br><br>
    I have seen each of you embody this in some way or another; I only hope to encourage you in continuing this embodiment and perhaps challenging the limits you or society has placed in terms of what can and cannot be done. As a coach, my goal is not to just hand you these lessons, but to give you each the opportunity to learn them for yourselves.
    <br><br>
    My hope is that you take these thoughts in consideration and take some time for yourself to really reflect on your past experience as a student athlete: what were your good/bad experiences, what attitude did you have at practice or at school, what have you learned, etc.
    <br><br>
    To give further inspiration for reflection I have pasted bellow a link to one of my favorite videos. It is a documentary on Ayrton Senna (SPOILERS in the wiki page if you don't want to know much about him before watching the documentary) who was an F1 driver in the 80s-90s. This documentary isn't the more well known one that is on Netflix but I still like this video because it talks more about about him as an athlete: his training, mindset, discipline, and focus. If you have an hour to spare, I highly recommend watching this; watch it while eating a meal if you need to save time.
    <br><br>

    Indeed this is not a complete definition of a student athlete, but it is a start to a conversation...something I hope that you continue to revisit and reflect upon throughout the season.
