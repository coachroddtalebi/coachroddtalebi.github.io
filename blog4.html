    <p>The first few weeks were all about cleaning the slate; new varsity and old varsity all just become ‘varsity’. We established a path to a single understanding of the perfect stroke, and we defined what we expect from each other as a team. There is always a need to increase our understandings there and to translate that into action, but we must also continue with bigger goals...progress is a process.<p>

    <p>With our slates all clean and a team identity being built, we enter October setting the stage for individuals to take on more responsibility and to assume their roles on this team. This, of course returns us to one of my many themes in team management: highlighting the reciprocal relationship and shared responsibility between an individual and their community…or team. So we shift from focusing on the just the team to focusing on the team and the individuals that define the team.</p>

    <br>
    <p><b>To my athletes:</b><br>
    This month is your chance to prove yourself to me and to your teammates. This is your chance to set the tone for this next year and for your athletic career as a whole. This is your chance to define what kind of athlete you want to be. How much are you willing to give to this team? How much are you willing to sacrifice? How do you prioritize your life and its choices?</p>

    <p>Every single day presents itself as an opportunity for you to grow and to challenge yourself. Notably for this month: first serious 6k of the season, lots of harder workouts both on water and on land, three two-a-day workouts, first head race, and captain elections. It's on you if you choose to waste these opportunities; remember the reciprocal relationship: an individual robbing themselves of the opportunity to grow, also robs the same from the team.</p>

    <p>The ideal personification of all of this: "My Boat, A-Boat". There is still over a month until the conversation of stacking boats begins, and yet I challenge each of you to make every boat you are in the A-Boat, the fastest boat, the best boat. Sometimes that means persistent focus at 14spm to find that perfect set, and other times it means establishing a rhythm and an efficient powerful drive at race pace; but it always means doing your best to be your best AND to get those around you to their best.</p>
