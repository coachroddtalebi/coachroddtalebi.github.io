Just putting down some notes on the cron job

Used this site
http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference

So first I created the shell file to run the python commands etc

Then I went to 'Energy Saver' and Scheduled the computer to wake up from 10am-1030am
BUT the computer has to connect to power adapter to work.

Then I did 'crontab -e' to edit the cron job.
Note that log files should be saved to this file.
