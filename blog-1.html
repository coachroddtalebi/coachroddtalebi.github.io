    With this blog, I hope that I can express my reasons and ideas, and provide context for what I do. The goal is to be just and reasonable in my decision-making and *relatively* transparent in my thought process so that all rowers share the same mental framework as myself. Frankly a coach needs the trust of the team to perform in his or her role. I do demand that trust but don't want it to be a blind trust. It is a fine line where a rower must understand the ‘coach-rower’ dynamic and be complicit in listening to the coach so that the actions and thoughts of the team are united, but at the same time there must be a reason for the rower to yield such freedoms to a single individual.<br><br>

    A few years back, I was introduced to this idea of a conceptual framework. Essentially it is an individual’s internal mode of processing and storing information, or the entire scope of a ‘thought process’. For example, each individual has a unique understanding of what ‘friendship’ is based on their previous relationships and experiences, things they have studied, and conversations they have had; and that understanding of ‘friendship’ will continue to shape their future relationships. This framework, that holds all our understandings of how our reality works, is ever evolving in a sort of symbiotic or recursive way; every new interaction adds to our understanding, and every new interaction is biased by our current understanding¬. As rowers, we spend a huge fraction of our time and our mental capacity in the sport; for that reason, I think it is important for everyone to take the time to think a little bit more critically about how we mentally approach practices, how we interact with each other on and off the water, and how we can more align our conceptual frameworks so that we can work better as a united team. This is certainly a theme I will return to throughout the year, but in short, everyone has a responsibility to reflect and well understand how he or she has a role in shaping the culture of this team. You will note that I will do my best to be very objective and specific about my expectations for this team; in theory, if I can share my understandings and thought processes with you all, the more we can all align in our conceptual frameworks in how we approach culture and management of the team.<br><br>

    A second theme I will continue to revisit throughout the year is the reciprocal relationship between the individual and the team in the advancement of our collective vision and goal. A stronger rower makes for a stronger team, but also a stronger team makes for a stronger rower. Make no mistake; this philosophy does give weight to the role of the individual but does not take away the role of the team; there will not be any room for ego; this will only work if every rower commits themselves to the same selfless goal: build a strong and fast Georgia Tech Women’s Rowing Team without compromising a moral code. Take for example a student; alone, he or she cannot take their studies and improve the world; and a group of students and mentor cannot improve the world around them without the time for individual study and growth. Everyone not only has the POTENTIAL to make an impact on this team, they have the RESPONSIBILITY to do so.<br><br>

    Note how I chose this first blog to be not about the technical aspect of the sport at all, but rather the more social aspect inherent to any sport. You'll work hard, train, and race for all four years, and, yes, you'll remember the wins and losses, the good and bad times, but what truly separates you from your peers at school is the character you develop and the type of person you become because of your time as a rower. To me that is a far lasting effect and my primary motivation for why I am here. At the end of the day, the way you treat each other is far more important to me than results. And for that reason this semester will be crucial to my plan in establishing a culture on the team that reflects this and I'll be looking for rowers to step up and champion this idea as their own.<br><br>

    It’s too easy to be okay with a team of assholes and dicks. If this sport has taught me anything, it’s this: it’s not about doing what’s easiest, it’s about doing what is most rewarding.
