    <h2>Team Goals</h2>
    I have several goals for this team, both long and short term. This next year will be strictly developmental in replacing a culture that gave room for individualism, low standards for competition, lack of commitment, and a void of structure. I'm a firm believer in building from the ground up; by establishing the right culture and mindset amongst the rowers, talent and quality on the water will surely soon follow. It is a long-term plan that will require a lot of patience and trust in the process. I hope to see Georgia Tech Women's Rowing return to the top of the podium for the 8+s at SIRA within 2-3 years, and at ACRA within 5 years. I will also be working closely with Brian to have the novice program reflect the expectations of the varsity program.<br>
    Specifically for this next year, what I expect to see after nine months of successful development of squad is to have team depth but not necessarily awesome speed. I want to see my worst rower row as well as my best rower; I want it be difficult to set lineups in stacking boats; I want each coxswain to be better than the other and to have them all out perform the coxswains of years past. I want to see depth in the team; only then can we really output dominatingly fast boats.
    
    <h2>Coaching Style</h2>
    I have chosen not to have assistant coaches (subject to change but the rest holds true) by relying more on the coxswains to fill that role and to be leaders in their boat. I will do my best to be explicit with what I expect technically from each rower so that eventually, each rower and each boat can essentially coach themselves and go through a practice independent from myself. I will be very hands on during the fall semester and then shift to giving more responsibility to the rowers and coxswains especially after lineups are set. A successful athlete in my program is one who quickly takes advantage of the resources around them to learn the stroke and to learn their weaknesses, so that they can individually work on what they need to be successful in the spring while motivating their teammates to do the same. The relationship between the individual rower and the whole team must be reciprocal in nature such that the success of the rower means the success of the team and the success of the team means the success of the individual rower. 

    <h2>The 'Varsity' Standard</h2>
    One of the biggest aspects of my strategy to change our team culture is to build the expectation that I have and that rowers should have of each other; both as athletes and teammates.<br><br>

    *Athletic Standards*<br>
    Varsity rowers are expected to have erged a 2km piece in under 8:30.00 (2:07.50 500m split) at some point in their career prior to the first day of the fall season practice. This will be enforced starting this fall (mild exception may be given for returning novices of 2016-17 season). Athletes who cannot meet the erg standard are welcome to stay on the team as coxswains but will not be boated as rowers (maybe small boats only).<br>
    Athletes (rowers and coxswains) are expected to be present for every practice. If an athlete fails to attend, a 15km piece is required to be completed prior to the next practice or the athlete won't be boated. An excuse can be given only for *serious* illnesses. In the event of a prior engagement overlapping with practice, notify me as soon as possible; a makeup workout will likely be assigned. A Google Form will be provided to athletes to notify myself of a future absence.<br><br>

    *Teammate Standards*<br>
    There will be a high moral code of conduct expected from all athletes. This is a team sport and I expect everyone to champion that in how they act. My number one rule is this: the team is your family, and the rowers your sisters; you do not have to be best friends with everyone, but you will respect and love every single one. If anyone challenges this rule, I will have a conversation with that rower and a warning will be issued; in addition, the head coach and officers will be notified to make sure that the process is handled correctly. In the event of a second misstep, that individual will be cut from the team. 

    <h2>Team Captains</h2>
    One month into the Fall Season, the varsity squad will elect one or two team captains, after nominations are approved by the coach. The role of Team Captain is to be a leader and a model in upholding the two 'Varsity Standards' on the women's squad. Athletes will have the prior season and the first month of the current season to personify the standards established above. The number one reason an athlete is elected to Team Captain should be because they have already exemplified the Varsity Standards. Currently only rowers are eligible to be elected as coxswains already hold similar roles...this is subject to change. This role is also completely separate from the officer board positions; this use is strictly internal.
    
    <h2>Coxswains</h2>
    My coaching style relies heavily on coxswain competency as I pass a lot of responsibility to them to lead and champion their boat as we head into the final half of the spring season. So I plan on putting a significant amount of focus on coxswain development in the first few weeks of the fall season. I expect all coxswains to be fluent with the technique and confident in their abilities in commanding a boat. During practice I am the coach, but during races and in the boat, they are the captains.<br>
    Tentatively there is a two-day coxswain camp scheduled for the weekend prior to the start of the fall Semester. 

    <h2>Schedule</h2> SUBJECT TO CHANGE but expect AM not PM practice.
    **athletes with 8am classes are free to leave once the boat hits the dock**<br>
    Monday - Wednesday: 5am leave campus, on the water by 5:30am, off the water by 7:00am, campus by 8:00am.<br>
    Thursday: Land Workout at CRC 6:30am<br>
    Friday: off<br>
    Saturday: on the water for morning practice<br>
    Sunday: either on the water in the mornings or at CRC for easy cardio, switching every other week<br>
    
    <h2>Race Schedule</h2>
    A team needs to have common goals and a shared vision to achieve those goals. This next year will be more developmental, especially in the fall, with the goal of going into SIRA with a deep and consistent squad; it's going to be about building and establishing a strong foundation to make it easier to find speed down the road.<br>
    
    The fall season will be a focus on building strength and technical competency and consistency throughout the squad. I will likely not stack boats for fall races until maybe HOTS; these are pre-season races. I am more interested in setting relatively even boats and seeing who steps up to give their boat extra speed. I don't view these as opportunities to race other schools; these are opportunities for athletes to practice racing and to race each other.<br>
    
    At this point in our development, it would not be conducive for the women's squad to attend the 2017 Head of the Charles Regatta. Again, our vision and plan for the next year has to align with our goals; and if our goal is to have a deep and consistent squad in the spring, it would not make sense to start off the fall season dividing the team into stacked boats and focusing on getting results for a meaningless fall regatta. Tentatively we will schedule two-a-day practices with the novice squad for that weekend and take full advantage of the river and our time.<br>

    In the spring, we will be building our season for SIRA and potentially for Vails and ACRA. SIRA will likely be the last race for most of the crew. Dad Vail Regatta is a highly competitive race and ACRA is a Club National Championship and we will treat them as such. It is up to the judgment of the coaches to determine what boats to race at the latter two races, but all are welcome to attend and support the team. Any boat that is planning on racing and will be competitive at ACRA will likely be given an invitation to row at Dad Vail; any boat that medalled at SIRA will also likely be given an invitation to row at Dad Vail.<br>

    There is also the possibility of replacing costly and time consuming regattas like FIRA with more practical scrimmages with our local competition: UGA, Clemson, Emory. Events that I will be focusing on are the heavyweight 8+ events, and the heavyweight 4+ events. We will fill boats in other events if we need to race rowers. My goal is to elevate the Georgia Tech Women's Rowing to a nationally ranked top 5 program; racing in lightweight events does not do that. <br>
