    <h2>Team Goals</h2>
    I have several goals for this team; both long and short term. This next year will be strictly developmental in replacing a culture that gave room for individualism, low standards for competition, lack of comitment, and a void of structure. I'm a firm believer in building from the ground up; by establishing the right culture and mindset amoungst the rowers, talent and quality on the water will surely soon follow. It is a long term plan that will require a lot of patience and trust in the process. I hope to see Georgia Tech Women's Rowing return to the top of the podium for the 8+s at SIRA within 2-3 years, and at ACRA within 5 years. I will also be working closely with Brian to have the novice program reflect the expectations of the varsity program.
    
    <h2>Coaching Style</h2>
    I have chosen not to have assistant coaches by relying on the coxswains to fill the role as leaders within the boat. I will do my best to be explicit in what I expect technically from each rower so that eventually, each rower and each boat can essentially coach themselves. I will be very hands on during the Fall semester and then shift to giving more responsibility to the rowers and coxswains especially after lineups are set. A successful athlete in my program is one who quickly takes advantage of the resources around them to learn the stroke and to learn their weaknesses, so that they can individually work on what they need to be successful in the Spring while motivating their teammates to do the same. The relationship between the individual rower and the whole team must be reciprocal in nature such that the success of the rower means the success of the team and the success of the team means the success of the individual.

    <h2>The 'Varsity' Standard</h2>
    One of the biggest parts of the strategy to change our team culture is to build the expectation that I have and that rowers should have for each other; both as an athlete and a teammate.<br><br>

    *Athletic Standards*<br>
    Varsity rowers are expected to have erged a 2km piece in under 8:30.00 (2:07.50 500m split) at some point in their career prior to the first day of the Fall season practice. This will be enforced starting this Fall. Athletes who could not meet the erg standard, are welcome to stay on the team as coxswains but will not be boated as a rower.<br>
    Athletes (rowers and coxswains) are expected to be present for every practice. If an athlete fails to attend, a 15km piece is required to completed prior to the next practice or the athlete won't be boated. An excuse can be given only for *serious* illnesses. In the event of a prior engagements overlapping with practice, makeup workouts can be done as a substitute with the approval of the coach beforehand. A Google Form will be provided to submit notification of a future absense of practice.<br><br>

    *Teammate Standards*<br>
    There will be a high moral standard expected from all athletes. This is a team sport and I expect everyone to champion that in how they act. My number one rule is this: this team is a family, and the rowers your sisters; you do not have to be best friends with everyone, but you will respect and love every single one. If anyone challenges this rule, I will have a conversation with that rower and warn them of their misdoings and alert the head coach and officers of this warning; in the event of a second challenge, that individual will be cut from the team.

    <h2>Team Captains</h2>
    One month into the Fall Season, one or two team captains will be elected by the varsity squad after nominations are approved by the coach. The role of Team Captains is to be a leader and a model in maintaining the two 'Varsity Standards' on the women's squad. Athletes will have the prior season and the first month of the current season to personify the standards established above. The number one reason an athlete is elected to Team Captain should be because they were already exeplary to the Varsity Standard. Currently only rowers are elligable to be elected as coxswains already hold similar roles...this is subject to change. This role is also competely separate from the officer board positions; this use is strictly internal.
    
    <h2>Coxswains</h2>
    Expectations of coxswains will be increased significantly. I expect them all to perform on the level of assistant coaches to myself. A coxswain bootcamp will be held prior to the first week of school.


    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    Monday - Wednesday: 5am leave campus, on the water by 5:30am, off the water by 7:00am, campus by 8:00am.<br>
    Thursday: Land Workout at CRC 6:30am<br>
    Friday: off<br>
    Saturday: on the water for morning practice<br>
    Sunday: either on the water in the mornings or at CRC for easy cardio switching every other week<br>
    
    <h2>Race Schedule</h2>
    We will likely not stack boats in the Fall until maybe HOTS. I'm more interested in setting relatively even boats and seeing who steps up to give their boat extra speed. I don't view these as opportunities to race other schools, these are opportunities to just race.<br>In the spring I'd like to try and do more scrimmages to build the racing experience. We will not attend FIRA; instead I will entertain the idea of doing a race for tanks with other local schools: UGA, Clemson, Emory.<br>SIRA will likely be the last race for most of the crew. Dad Vail Regatta is a highly competitive race and ACRA is a Club National Championship and we will treat it as such. It is up to the judgement of the coachs' to determine what boats to race at the latter two races, but all are welcome to attend and support the team. Any boat that is planning on racing and will be competitive at ACRA will likely be given an invitation to row at Dad Vail; any boat that medalled at SIRA will also likely be given an invitation to row at Dad Vail.<br>
    Events that I will be focusing on are the heavyweight 8 events, and the heavyweight 4 events. We will fill boats in other events if we need to race rowers. My goal is to elevate the Georgia Tech Women's Rowing to a nationaly ranked top 5 programs; racing in lightweight events does not do that.
