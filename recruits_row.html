We are looking for elite high school athletes willing to transition to a new sport to be able to continue to compete at a high level. Club Rowing offers the unique experiences of building high expectations for competitive athletes competing on high level on both an athletic and academic level. True to the name of a student athlete. 
True to the name of a student athletes, Georgia Tech rowers distinguish themselves from their peers by prioritizing both their academic and athletic career above all else. Rowers are all primarily accepted to Georgia Tech because of their academic and professional potential and then voluntarily choose to sacrifice their time and energies to carry on the legacy and to venture into new fronteirs of greatness. Our athletes leave Georgia Tech and stand out amoungst their peers, not only with their world class education, but also because of their untangible mental strength that allowed them to be full time students and full time athletes.

In the past two years, Coach Michael Gibel transformed the face of Georgia Tech Men's Rowing. In his short tenure he has brought more Dad Vail's Gold Medals to Tech than the cummulation of all years past. This past spring he was asked to take over the role of Head Coach for the entire program while continueing to coach the men. In addition, Coach Rodd Talebi was asked to take over and coach the women's squad. For the first time in years, the two squads are working together to make Georgia Tech the premier club for both men's and women's rowing, competing against schools across the country like University of California Santa Barbara, Grand Valley, and Purdue.

This brings us to you. Our hope is to find those individuals ready to take on a new challenge both academically and athletically. Do you have what it takes to study with the worlds brightest? Do you have the mental and physical strength to endure and throw down with the country's most talented? Do you have the guts to welcome the challenges that others would run from? Then we are looking for you.

Continue reading bellow to learn more about Georgia Tech, the Rowing Club, recent graduates and alumni, and to contact the coaches to show your interest.

    <h1>Georgia Tech Rowing Team</h1>
    <p>We are looking for motivated high school rowers ready to transition to the next level of competition. True to the name of a student athletes, Georgia Tech rowers distinguish themselves from their peers by prioritizing both their academic and athletic careers.</p>
    <p>Rowers are accepted to Georgia Tech because of their academic and professional potential, and only then do they commit themselves to the team and carry on the legacy. Our athletes leave Georgia Tech and stand out amongst their peers, not only with their world class education, but also because of their un-teachable mental strength that allowed them to be fulltime students and fulltime athletes.</p>
    <p>Our program is the premier and most competitive club program at Tech. We train 6 days a week, starting with the first week of school in the fall and ending in May a few weeks after the spring semester ends.</p>
  <!--
    <p>OLD STUFF...We are a top teir competitive club team at georgia tech and compete against other school at the local and national level. we offer best of all worlds when it comes to university living; the family like the greek system, the networking opportunity with alumni like social clubs, academic guidance from peers and upperclassmen, and the unique opportunity to compete at a high colliegate level. All Tech rowers were accepted to this university because of their academics so we take that very seriously, but these special individuals separate themselves from their peers by choosing to also excel athletically.</p>

    <h1>The Coaching Staff</h1>

    </p>
  <!--
    <p>THE OLD STUFF...Led by Coach Michael on the men's side, and Coach Rodd on the women's side, Georgia Tech rowing has been undergoing a transformation and is on track to establish itself on the national bracket, and the incoming class of freshman rowers recognize the University's strong academic caliber matched with the recent growth of the rowing team. <br>
    In the past two years, Coach Mike has brought the men's team ....<br>
    In the same time, the fruits of Coach Rodd's efforts as an assistant is starting to bear as the women's team reenters talks for Southern club domination. This past offseason, he was asked to return as the Women's Head Coach under the guidance of the Team Head Coach, Mike Gibel. It is the hope that this partnership will push Georgia Tech further into the discussion of national championships.</p>

<div id="Deal" class="container-fluid">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h1>The Deal</h1>
    <p>At Georgia Tech we are unapologetically a club team.</p>
    <p>We don't have the funds or the facilities like NCAA or IRA teams but we have the grit. Rowers joining our team with experience, walk-on as varsity athletes (not as novices), but receive absolutely zero special treatment outside of that. Our hope is to find those individuals ready to take on a new challenge both academically and athletically. Do you have what it takes to study with the worlds brightest? Do you have the mental and physical strength to endure and throw down with the country's most talented? Do you have the guts to welcome the challenges that others would run from? Then we are looking for you.</p>
    <p>We can connect you with our athletes in similar fields of study, and potentially give guidance on your application to Georgia Tech. Our network gives you access to students currently enrolled for advice on classes, and to young professionals for building connections. Starting Day 1 of your freshman year, you will have a whole support system behind you, ready to build you up as an athlete, as a student, and as a professional.</p>
    <p>There will be a weekend in the spring for high school rowers to come visit the campus, sit in on practice, and get to know the team. The weekend date is still 'to be decided'. Sign up below, under 'Contact', to get email updates from the coaches.</p>
  <!--
    <p>THE OLD STUFF...We are looking for high school athletes (any sport) who rank Georgia Tech as one of their top choices for university and who have a strong interest in walking on to join the team. <br>
    Like most collegiate rowing programs in the country, we are a club team, so, like other club teams, we are not allowed to offer any sway in the admissions decission of the school nor offer any scholarships. What we can offer is a headstart in networking and establishing yourself at Georgia Tech and assistance in your application. </p>
